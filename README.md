# Metazoan Zinc finger genes coevolve with transposable elements
This repository contains scripts and analyses related to a large survey of
metazoan Zinc finger genes (ZNFs). ZNFs are the largest family of transcription
factors in animals, and have undergone extensive, lineage-specific expansions
and contractions in copy number. The evolutionary forces driving this dynamism
are poorly understood. In this project, we explore the hypothesis that genomic
conflict with TEs explains the rapid evolution of metazoan ZNFs.
